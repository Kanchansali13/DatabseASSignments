1) Write a query that will give you all orders for more than Rs. 1,000. 
 select *from orders where Amt > 1000;

2)Write a query that will give you the names and cities of all salespeople in
London with a commission above .10.

4)What will be the output from the following query?

 Select * from Orders
 where (amt < 1000 OR
 NOT (odate = '1990-10-03'
 AND cnum > 2003));

5)What will be the output of the following query?

 Select * from Orders

 >1006) AND amt >= 1500); 

-->it shows table consist of coloumn Onum,Amt,Odate,Cnum,Snum.

6)What is a simpler way to write this query?
